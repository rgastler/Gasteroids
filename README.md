# Gasteroids
This is my attempt at a version/recreating of the original Asteroids game using pygame.  The sound quality is pretty bad, but I am not an expert amd just wanted some basic sounds in the game.  In addition, my code organization leaves something to be desired.  I imagine things could be split into multiple files in a natural way, but I don't have a grip on how that is typically done at this point.  There isn't a hard "end in mind" for this program as it is just a fun project to practice a bit of python.    

Imports needed: pygame, random, time, math, sys

For the game, UP arrow is thrust, LEFT and RIGHT rotate the ship, SPACE shoots, and P pauses.  In game button functions are straight forward.
